## 🎨 Customization Guide

### **Colors & Branding**
The website uses CSS custom properties for easy color customization. Edit `css/styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #7c3aed;    /* Purple - your main brand color */
    --secondary-color: #fbbf24;  /* Yellow/Gold - accent color */
    --accent-color: #ec4899;     /* Pink - additional accent */
    --text-dark: #1f2937;       /* Dark text */
    --text-light: #6b7280;      /* Light text */
    --bg-light: #f9fafb;        /* Light background */
}
```

### **Fonts**
The website uses Google Fonts. To change fonts, update the `<link>` tag in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Current fonts -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playfair+Display:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

<!-- Example: Change to different fonts -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cormorant+Garamond:wght@400;500;600;700&family=Montserrat:wght@300;400;500;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Then update the CSS classes:
```css
.font-playfair { font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; }
.font-inter { font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; }
```

### **Adding New Sections**
To add new sections (e.g., "About Us", "Services"), follow this pattern:

```html
<!-- Add to navigation -->
<a href="#about" class="nav-link text-gray-700 hover:text-purple-600 px-3 py-2 rounded-md text-sm font-medium transition-colors">About</a>

<!-- Add section content -->
<section id="about" class="py-16 bg-white">
    <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
        <div class="text-center mb-12">
            <h2 class="font-playfair text-4xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">About Us</h2>
            <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
                Your about us content here...
            </p>
